Its surface is covered with tens of thousands of impact craters. From Mercury's surface, the Sun would appear more than three times larger than when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be up to 11 times brighter. Mercury is the fastest planet and revolves around the Sun every 88 Earth days. Mercury is appropriately named after the fastest of the ancient Roman gods. The first spacecraft to visit Mercury was Mariner 10, which imaged 45% of its surface. NASA's MESSENGER (MErcury Surface, Space ENvironment, GEochemistry, and Ranging) mission passed Mercury three times in 2008-2009 and orbited the planet from 2011 to 2015, mapping the entire surface."

It is surrounded by faint rings and more than two dozen small moons as it rotates at an angle of nearly 90 degrees to the plane of its orbit. This unique tilt makes Uranus appear to spin sideways. Uranus is blue-green in color due to large amounts of methane, which absorbs red light but allows blues to reflect back into space. The atmosphere is composed mainly of hydrogen and helium, but also includes large amounts of water, ammonia, and methane. Astronomer William Herschel unsuccessfully attempted to name his discovery Georgium Sidus in honor of his patron, English King George III. Instead, the planet was eventually named after Uranus, the Greek god of the sky, who was also the father of Cronus (or Saturn in Roman mythology)"

Our nearest planetary neighbor, the second planet from the Sun, has a surface hot enough to melt lead. The atmosphere is so thick that, from the surface, the Sun is just a speck of light. It is more an opposite of Earth than a twin: Venus spins backwards, has a day longer than its year, and lacks any semblance of seasons. It may once have been a habitable ocean world, like Earth, but that was at least a billion years ago. A runaway greenhouse effect turned all the surface water into vapor, which then slowly seeped out into space. Today's surface volcanic rock is affected by high temperatures and pressures. Venus may offer lessons on what it takes for life to begin: on Earth, in our solar system, or throughout the galaxy. The ingredients are all there, or at least they used to be. By studying why our neighboring world took such a different direction with respect to habitability, we might discover what could make other worlds right. The temperature, air pressure, and chemistry are much nicer higher up in those thick, yellow clouds"

Neptune, more than 30 times farther from the Sun than Earth, is not visible to the naked eye. In 2011, Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery. The planet's rich blue color comes from methane in its atmosphere, which absorbs red wavelengths of light but allows blue wavelengths to reflect back into space. Neptune was the first planet located by mathematical calculations. Using predictions sent to him by French astronomer Urbain Le Verrier, based on perturbations in the orbit of Uranus, German astronomer Johann Galle was the first to observe the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier."
